# dna-svelte

Personal influence DNA project for webdev study.

Releases should goto: https://dna.darthvid.com/

0. The [initial version](https://github.com/tehdarthvid/old-dna) was a forced Vue insertion to a basic HTML/CSS/JS site, with the cards derived from [Parallax Depth Cards with Vue.js](https://vuejsexamples.com/parallax-depth-cards-with-vue-js/).
1. It was then [re-implemented to ReactJS](https://github.com/tehdarthvid/dna-react) for learning React/Redux.
1. It was then moved back to a full [VueJS/Vuex CLI 2 stable](https://github.com/tehdarthvid/dna-vue-cli-2) setup for comparion with React. This was very shortly moved to [VueJS/Vuex CLI 3 beta](https://github.com/tehdarthvid/dna-vue) for kicks! :)

1. This project... I'll call a 3rd iteration to get my feet wet on Svelte! (^u^)

Just playing around to study web development. You'll find the code can get dirty... that's 'coz I'll be tryin' stuff out! It'll get messy, mistakes will be made made, then we figure it out, clean it up, and hopefully we'll end up learning something! (^u^)

We start with a blank Svelte template via "npx degit sveltejs/template [my-project]" as per [The easiest way to get started with Svelte](https://svelte.dev/blog/the-easiest-way-to-get-started).
